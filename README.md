# kisbaranta
An everyday man's 40-day excercise in life - done according to old Hungarian values.

Albeit the whole thing is for personal purposes, I tried to structure things so you can clone this repo to do your own "kisbaranta". My original progress and trial-run will be found in the /example/README.md file which starts out as a copy of this template plan.

## Reasoning for the cause

I work in an office, have busy life, have my own problems when it comes to temptations and when I am at home I also procrastinate or just kill the time in any unproductive ways. Basically I live in todays modern world - but I feel wrong about it and I hope many other people feel like this too. Soon there is the time for fasting before the Easter - a period of cleansing that lasts 40 days - and it came the idea to do something. To try pushing for a short perfection in soul, body and mind. Some period where one try to organize and live up to predefined values, keep his/her soul strong to always choose only the good paths.

You might think you are free of bigger problems, but be warned: I was never a useless human flesh, always tried to act wisely and have a quite decent life already. I am a stable-working programmer / computer scientist, village guy with hobby wine field that I work on with manual labour and having the best girlfriend I can imagine. I was even in the media because of work and usually have my success so this is not a "yet-another-clueless-guy-telling-stuff" thing. Actually I do not even want followship just an open place I can access from anywhere to document the progress. My personal goal is to see how is ones productivity when it is really on the top and to do some real cleansing in mind, body and soul. It does not count if I am productive "anyways" when I am more lazy - this is a simple test to measure where I could have been.

Why is it called "kisbaranta"? After I thought about the whole idea it was quite lucid to me that this 40 days will resemble martial arts, spartan life and such. But this is surely more closely tied to God, Values, Spirit too and a Hungarian way of life too. Baranta is a Hungarian marital art that tries to collect moves and training for the expert horse riders and the top-line of traditional nomadic warfare forces. They do an awsome job and name it Baranta because that means the armed or war excercise - also meaning however a moral value set. I never did Baranta and maybe would be too wimpy for it these days, but when I was thinking about how to name this thing and names for foreign stuff came to my head "kata" or "kumite" I thought to myself: I am no Japanese to call this 40 days like that! I will call it "kisbaranta", which translates to "small-baranta" and thus maybe will not upset those who do real Baranta (which is not small at all).

## 40-day long excercise of the soul, mind and body

The excercise will took 40 days for which a calendar-like structure is presented here. The first week is a truncated week on which excercise starts only on wednesday - according to the traditional catholic fasting before Easter.

The excercise plan consists of:

* **(Kitartás)** Daily activities: Must must be done every workday - except for emergency situations or cultural/family needs.
* **(Ráadás)** Saturdays: To make more progress in specific goals here we find a whole day for our purposes!
* **(Látás)** Sundays: This day is the family and religious resting day albeit one can work out or work if they prefer to.
* **(Böjt)** Values to do, forbidden activities to not do and thresholds: The original fasting goals - including religious practices.
* **(Cél)** Specific goals: These must be small and easily done - but procrastinated.

For the first three points, I will present a calendar-like structure in which the continuous day to day tasks will be listed as columns and the days as rowns. The 'O' character in a row/column pair represents the thing has not been done (yet) and an 'X' means it has been done. The columns I use are specific to my case, so feel free to change them according to your needs. As you can see, the saturdays and sundays are having different columns as usual workdays. This not only structures the calendar-like system, but also makes sense because they are different kind of things as above is written in short. The saturdays should be used actively for progressing in good and are a very nice resource for a person with goals to help himself and his surroundings. The sundays should be however kept for lighter - no progress can be forced on this day and one should rest - but not in a meaningless way, but to spend it with family, God, go to Church, meditate and think back for the week, play music if otherwise one would not do and ensure we go to bed early. The latest is of personal importance too in my case as I am commuting to work and monday will start to be really unproductive if I got to bed after 22:00. Let's aim for 20:30 for best practice.

The (Böjt) and (Cél) points are not cheduled. The first point tells which lifestyle to live and what we need to keep from ourselves, what we need to do generally. The second are some specific small personal goals - are to be checked in the end of 40 days. The latter is basically a checklist for long-procrastinated-simple-stuff that needs to be done and yet are not done for any reason. Do not put here very big things!

If the system is used over github - as in my case - and you try to adhere to pushing changes every day the github indicator will be a very good indicator about how well or badly this system is followed.

After all the fuss and complication in making the idea, I really hope that I can stick to the system for 40 days and not "just get bored". At least if I fail miserably, the system is here for the next year. Also in the calendar there is a minus-point for every day which you can give to yourself for whatever reason.

In order for this to work, I figured that measuring progress should be done easily. In order to make that happen, the calendar needs to be prepared in advance - with all your activities. This customization is best done right before the wednesday when you start - at least that is how I feel about it right now.
