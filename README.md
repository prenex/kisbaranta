# kisbaranta
An everyday man's 40-day excercise in life - done according to old Hungarian values.

Albeit the whole thing is for personal purposes, I tried to structure things so you can clone this repo to do your own "kisbaranta". My original progress and trial-run will be found in the /example/README.md file which starts out as a copy of this template plan.

## Reasoning for the cause

I work in an office, have busy life, have my own problems when it comes to temptations and when I am at home I also procrastinate or just kill the time in any unproductive ways. Basically I live in todays modern world - but I feel wrong about it and I hope many other people feel like this too. Soon there is the time for fasting before the Easter - a period of cleansing that lasts 40 days - and it came the idea to do something. To try pushing for a short perfection in soul, body and mind. Some period where one try to organize and live up to predefined values, keep his/her soul strong to always choose only the good paths.

You might think you are free of bigger problems, but be warned: I was never a useless human flesh, always tried to act wisely and have a quite decent life already. I am a stable-working programmer / computer scientist, village guy with hobby wine field that I work on with manual labour and having the best girlfriend I can imagine. I was even in the media because of work and usually have my success so this is not a "yet-another-clueless-guy-telling-stuff" thing. Actually I do not even want followship just an open place I can access from anywhere to document the progress. My personal goal is to see how is ones productivity when it is really on the top and to do some real cleansing in mind, body and soul. It does not count if I am productive "anyways" when I am more lazy - this is a simple test to measure where I could have been.

Why is it called "kisbaranta"? After I thought about the whole idea it was quite lucid to me that this 40 days will resemble martial arts, spartan life and such. But this is surely more closely tied to God, Values, Spirit too and a Hungarian way of life too. Baranta is a Hungarian marital art that tries to collect moves and training for the expert horse riders and the top-line of traditional nomadic warfare forces. They do an awsome job and name it Baranta because that means the armed or war excercise - also meaning however a moral value set. I never did Baranta and maybe would be too wimpy for it these days, but when I was thinking about how to name this thing and names for foreign stuff came to my head "kata" or "kumite" I thought to myself: I am no Japanese to call this 40 days like that! I will call it "kisbaranta", which translates to "small-baranta" and thus maybe will not upset those who do real Baranta (which is not small at all).

## 40-day long excercise of the soul, mind and body

The excercise will took 40 days for which a calendar-like structure is presented here. The first week is a truncated week on which excercise starts only on wednesday - according to the traditional catholic fasting before Easter.

The excercise plan consists of:

* **(Kitartás)** Daily activities: Must must be done every workday - except for emergency situations or cultural/family needs.
* **(Ráadás)** Saturdays: To make more progress in specific goals here we find a whole day for our purposes!
* **(Látás)** Sundays: This day is the family and religious resting day albeit one can work out or work if they prefer to.
* **(Böjt)** Values to do, forbidden activities to not do and thresholds: The original fasting goals - including religious practices.
* **(Cél)** Specific goals: These must be small and easily done - but procrastinated.

For the first three points, I will present a calendar-like structure in which the continuous day to day tasks will be listed as columns and the days as rowns. The 'O' character in a row/column pair represents the thing has not been done (yet) and an 'X' means it has been done. The columns I use are specific to my case, so feel free to change them according to your needs. As you can see, the saturdays and sundays are having different columns as usual workdays. This not only structures the calendar-like system, but also makes sense because they are different kind of things as above is written in short. The saturdays should be used actively for progressing in good and are a very nice resource for a person with goals to help himself and his surroundings. The sundays should be however kept for lighter - no progress can be forced on this day and one should rest - but not in a meaningless way, but to spend it with family, God, go to Church, meditate and think back for the week, play music if otherwise one would not do and ensure we go to bed early. The latest is of personal importance too in my case as I am commuting to work and monday will start to be really unproductive if I got to bed after 22:00. Let's aim for 20:30 for best practice.

The (Böjt) and (Cél) points are not cheduled. The first point tells which lifestyle to live and what we need to keep from ourselves, what we need to do generally. The second are some specific small personal goals - are to be checked in the end of 40 days. The latter is basically a checklist for long-procrastinated-simple-stuff that needs to be done and yet are not done for any reason. Do not put here very big things!

If the system is used over github - as in my case - and you try to adhere to pushing changes every day the github indicator will be a very good indicator about how well or badly this system is followed.

After all the fuss and complication in making the idea, I really hope that I can stick to the system for 40 days and not "just get bored". At least if I fail miserably, the system is here for the next year. Also in the calendar there is a minus-point for every day which you can give to yourself for whatever reason.

In order for this to work, I figured that measuring progress should be done easily. In order to make that happen, the calendar needs to be prepared in advance - with all your activities. This customization is best done right before the wednesday when you start - at least that is how I feel about it right now.

	Hét - Easter (Just be happy and celebrate God here whatever happens)

The above should be understood as:

* **Badme**: This is the only negative thing in the table: this will happen to get a '-' sign if I feel dishonoured about a specific day for any reason (temptations, bad things, bad word, or anything that one feels bad for)
* **GetUpOk**: I should get up in a way so that my father with whom I commute together is never feeling we are late because of me so he can relax and drive without stress. I arrive at work well before 7:00 and need to be prepared at most 5:35 for this.
* **Pray**: I think it is quite an awsome idea to use the time in the car to pray a bit. Not for oneself of course, but for my nation, my girlfriend, our families, good causes and poor people of course.
* **Pushups**: I cannot do too much excercise before work as I cannot smell like crazy, but I might do 10-20 push ups throughout the day.
* **Work++**: I should be really productive at work! Nothing should kill my focus - especially not things that are useless!!! Working with full focus will be a very big thing - even though I am usually trying anyways. Working with focus should ensure no overwork.
* **Lunch**: I figured that I will go out and go to the close other building where there is better food. Also I will have to go out our building and walk a bit more in the middle of the day which seems healthy anyways. Also I already always take the stairs so if I do not do that I should not tick this neither! I also cannot eat menu with cake in it (sometimes it is free! No and not!) and always will eat in a way that I should not feel completely filled. This last will be very hard to do, but one does not need to fill completely for right energy level.
* **LeaveOk**: As my father gather me and he otherwise need to wait, I should be well prepared and leave at the right time. The work++ point earlier is really nevessary to do this point well too as the extra productivity and focus is necessary for leaving always on time. If I do this well, I should get home around 17:30
* **Pray**: While I will be in the car... See above.
* **Workout**: I should do 15 minutes at least on workdays. Mostly pushup, stomach, simple things.
* **Walkrun**: Absolute minimum is to go out and walk around 15-30 minutes - maybe before workout actually. I seat like crazy so running in very cold might be dangerous for someone doing rarely. On weekends this needs to be running or swimming however (or doing crazy big walk in the forest or something very active - concert might count, but only if not wasted on alcohol!)
* **Dinner**: I figure I can get a point here if I do not eat bread. Sometimes there will be nothing else, but I should prefer eggs or muzli with milk. Before the fasting I ate bread in the morning and in the dinner - now only in the morning for this 40 days - or no point here.
* **Thesis**: I need to work on my thesis - either the program I need to write or its text. Just thinking about it does not count as I do that anyways of course. Only real and measurable progress count which should mean a git push towards my git repo for the thesis. Time can be anything but a relevant git push should happen usually (it must be really rare to not be able to push and need to undo everything but of course possible even if I work on it - that is not a goal though). On sunday I do not need to push upline changes, but I am still encouraged. On saturdays it is of primary thing to do along with proper moving and culture.
* **GfAvail**: I cannot know if I will be able to talk with my love and spend time with her or not, but I want to make myself available. For this I will log in to facebook on my phone which hopefully notifies me with some noise. I will be available from 20:00 - possibly earlier if I did things fast enough. I cannot stay longer on weekdays than 21:15, but if she arrives she will get my dedicated time alone <3. If I calculate well I should be able to work on my thesis before this fast enough to keep the daily rythm.
* **SleepOk**: I need to go to the bed at 21:15 so that I can fall asleep as fast as I can - very hopefully at least before 22:00. This is NECESSARY as otherwise I will feel too tired to do my things. If I fail to do so for a day, I might push hard for the next one. Also I should be not tired like death and be able to do a proper night prayer.
* **Guitar**: If I can I should practice guitar - I guess mostly only will happen on saturdays.
* **Order**: On saturdays I plan to make order - minimally in my room vacuming and small order keeping and hopefully also elsewhere.
