# kisbaranta
An everyday man's 40-day excercise in life - done according to old Hungarian values.

Albeit the whole thing is for personal purposes, I tried to structure things so you can clone this repo to do your own "kisbaranta". My original progress and trial-run will be found in the /example/README.md file which starts out as a copy of this template plan.

## Reasoning for the cause

I work in an office, have busy life, have my own problems when it comes to temptations and when I am at home I also procrastinate or just kill the time in any unproductive ways. Basically I live in todays modern world - but I feel wrong about it and I hope many other people feel like this too. Soon there is the time for fasting before the Easter - a period of cleansing that lasts 40 days - and it came the idea to do something. To try pushing for a short perfection in soul, body and mind. Some period where one try to organize and live up to predefined values, keep his/her soul strong to always choose only the good paths.

You might think you are free of bigger problems, but be warned: I was never a useless human flesh, always tried to act wisely and have a quite decent life already. I am a stable-working programmer / computer scientist, village guy with hobby wine field that I work on with manual labour and having the best girlfriend I can imagine. I was even in the media because of work and usually have my success so this is not a "yet-another-clueless-guy-telling-stuff" thing. Actually I do not even want followship just an open place I can access from anywhere to document the progress. My personal goal is to see how is ones productivity when it is really on the top and to do some real cleansing in mind, body and soul. It does not count if I am productive "anyways" when I am more lazy - this is a simple test to measure where I could have been.

Why is it called "kisbaranta"? After I thought about the whole idea it was quite lucid to me that this 40 days will resemble martial arts, spartan life and such. But this is surely more closely tied to God, Values, Spirit too and a Hungarian way of life too. Baranta is a Hungarian marital art that tries to collect moves and training for the expert horse riders and the top-line of traditional nomadic warfare forces. They do an awsome job and name it Baranta because that means the armed or war excercise - also meaning however a moral value set. I never did Baranta and maybe would be too wimpy for it these days, but when I was thinking about how to name this thing and names for foreign stuff came to my head "kata" or "kumite" I thought to myself: I am no Japanese to call this 40 days like that! I will call it "kisbaranta", which translates to "small-baranta" and thus maybe will not upset those who do real Baranta (which is not small at all).

## 40-day long excercise of the soul, mind and body

The excercise will took 40 days for which a calendar-like structure is presented here. The first week is a truncated week on which excercise starts only on wednesday - according to the traditional catholic fasting before Easter.

The excercise plan consists of:

* **(Kitartás)** Daily activities: Must must be done every workday - except for emergency situations or cultural/family needs.
* **(Ráadás)** Saturdays: To make more progress in specific goals here we find a whole day for our purposes!
* **(Látás)** Sundays: This day is the family and religious resting day albeit one can work out or work if they prefer to.
* **(Böjt)** Values to do, forbidden activities to not do and thresholds: The original fasting goals - including religious practices.
* **(Cél)** Specific goals: These must be small and easily done - but procrastinated.

For the first three points, I will present a calendar-like structure in which the continuous day to day tasks will be listed as columns and the days as rowns. The 'O' character in a row/column pair represents the thing has not been done (yet) and an 'X' means it has been done. The columns I use are specific to my case, so feel free to change them according to your needs. As you can see, the saturdays and sundays are having different columns as usual workdays. This not only structures the calendar-like system, but also makes sense because they are different kind of things as above is written in short. The saturdays should be used actively for progressing in good and are a very nice resource for a person with goals to help himself and his surroundings. The sundays should be however kept for lighter - no progress can be forced on this day and one should rest - but not in a meaningless way, but to spend it with family, God, go to Church, meditate and think back for the week, play music if otherwise one would not do and ensure we go to bed early. The latest is of personal importance too in my case as I am commuting to work and monday will start to be really unproductive if I got to bed after 22:00. Let's aim for 20:30 for best practice.

The (Böjt) and (Cél) points are not cheduled. The first point tells which lifestyle to live and what we need to keep from ourselves, what we need to do generally. The second are some specific small personal goals - are to be checked in the end of 40 days. The latter is basically a checklist for long-procrastinated-simple-stuff that needs to be done and yet are not done for any reason. Do not put here very big things!

If the system is used over github - as in my case - and you try to adhere to pushing changes every day the github indicator will be a very good indicator about how well or badly this system is followed.

After all the fuss and complication in making the idea, I really hope that I can stick to the system for 40 days and not "just get bored". At least if I fail miserably, the system is here for the next year. Also in the calendar there is a minus-point for every day which you can give to yourself for whatever reason.

In order for this to work, I figured that measuring progress should be done easily. In order to make that happen, the calendar needs to be prepared in advance - with all your activities. This customization is best done right before the wednesday when you start - at least that is how I feel about it right now.

	Hét - Easter (Just be happy and celebrate God here whatever happens)

The above should be understood as:

* **Badme**: This is the only negative thing in the table: this will happen to get a '-' sign if I feel dishonoured about a specific day for any reason (temptations, bad things, bad word, or anything that one feels bad for)
* **GetUpOk**: I should get up in a way so that my father with whom I commute together is never feeling we are late because of me so he can relax and drive without stress. I arrive at work well before 7:00 and need to be prepared at most 5:35 for this.
* **Pray**: I think it is quite an awsome idea to use the time in the car to pray a bit. Not for oneself of course, but for my nation, my girlfriend, our families, good causes and poor people of course.
* **Pushups**: I cannot do too much excercise before work as I cannot smell like crazy, but I might do 10-20 push ups throughout the day.
* **Work++**: I should be really productive at work! Nothing should kill my focus - especially not things that are useless!!! Working with full focus will be a very big thing - even though I am usually trying anyways. Working with focus should ensure no overwork.
* **Lunch**: I figured that I will go out and go to the close other building where there is better food. Also I will have to go out our building and walk a bit more in the middle of the day which seems healthy anyways. Also I already always take the stairs so if I do not do that I should not tick this neither! I also cannot eat menu with cake in it (sometimes it is free! No and not!) and always will eat in a way that I should not feel completely filled. This last will be very hard to do, but one does not need to fill completely for right energy level.
* **LeaveOk**: As my father gather me and he otherwise need to wait, I should be well prepared and leave at the right time. The work++ point earlier is really nevessary to do this point well too as the extra productivity and focus is necessary for leaving always on time. If I do this well, I should get home around 17:30
* **Pray**: While I will be in the car... See above.
* **Workout**: I should do 15 minutes at least on workdays. Mostly pushup, stomach, simple things.
* **Walkrun**: Absolute minimum is to go out and walk around 15-30 minutes - maybe before workout actually. I seat like crazy so running in very cold might be dangerous for someone doing rarely. On weekends this needs to be running or swimming however (or doing crazy big walk in the forest or something very active - concert might count, but only if not wasted on alcohol!)
* **Dinner**: I figure I can get a point here if I do not eat bread. Sometimes there will be nothing else, but I should prefer eggs or muzli with milk. Before the fasting I ate bread in the morning and in the dinner - now only in the morning for this 40 days - or no point here.
* **Thesis**: I need to work on my thesis - either the program I need to write or its text. Just thinking about it does not count as I do that anyways of course. Only real and measurable progress count which should mean a git push towards my git repo for the thesis. Time can be anything but a relevant git push should happen usually (it must be really rare to not be able to push and need to undo everything but of course possible even if I work on it - that is not a goal though). On sunday I do not need to push upline changes, but I am still encouraged. On saturdays it is of primary thing to do along with proper moving and culture.
* **GfAvail**: I cannot know if I will be able to talk with my love and spend time with her or not, but I want to make myself available. For this I will log in to facebook on my phone which hopefully notifies me with some noise. I will be available from 20:00 - possibly earlier if I did things fast enough. I cannot stay longer on weekdays than 21:15, but if she arrives she will get my dedicated time alone <3. If I calculate well I should be able to work on my thesis before this fast enough to keep the daily rythm.
* **SleepOk**: I need to go to the bed at 21:15 so that I can fall asleep as fast as I can - very hopefully at least before 22:00. This is NECESSARY as otherwise I will feel too tired to do my things. If I fail to do so for a day, I might push hard for the next one. Also I should be not tired like death and be able to do a proper night prayer.
* **Guitar**: If I can I should practice guitar - I guess mostly only will happen on saturdays.
* **Order**: On saturdays I plan to make order - minimally in my room vacuming and small order keeping and hopefully also elsewhere.

### Böjt - Values to do, forbidden activities to not do and thresholds

1. Try not to play over night or against sleep - actually don't do anything that keeps one up later than it should be (let it be a game, internet or actually even work or the thesis project). It is really harmful to the next day, so this is best avoided.

2. Try to not look at porn. Thank God I managed to only view very small amount. My girlfriend is beautiful anyways - both in body and soul ;-)

3. Try to not eat a lot of candies or sugar - actually towards the end I failed this a bit, but in the beginning it was OK.

4. Try to not overdo answering to politics or flamewar messages (latter mostly on proghu). This one was not originally on my list, but I grew to see that some people or forums does not worth attention.

5. I tried to eat less meat on fridays - or not at all. I was not flawless in this, but it was measurable difference and on bigger fasting days I always kept it on the usual weeks I kept it at least half the time if I have not forgotten

6. Try to be good: Kindness towards people, thinking more from their point of view when possible, going against any illegal stuff... whatever

### Cél - Specific personal goal checklist

1. **FINISHED:** Getting to know thesis deadlines for my university - going there and asking personally: Finished! Those who started the university after 2006 and before 2012 need to apply a law in which you might need asking special admission for finishing if 7 years have passed - but only if the uniersity faculty is asking for this special procedure. In my case my university is not asking for the special procedure after 7 years, so I can get my diploma basically even as a pensioner (the woman said). Those who started AFTER 2012 need to finish in 5 years to the absolutorium at most (but this does not apply to me) and those who started before 2006 have 14 or more years or something (also don't apply to me). It seems miraculously I went to the university exactly in the period that lets me freely choose. I will continue writing my thesis though so that I can finish as early as I can.

2. **FINISHED - not available:** Getting to know how I can buy the house and land in the nice place: It was a house that my family owned once and there seems to be a possibility to get it back. It is in a very bad condition so I think of the place as "land" and would build our own house there. It must be a cheap buy for its bad condition but it lies in an awsome place which is good to build our own house on. If I can spend on it reasonable amounts I should even buy it immediately (I do not even need to ask my girlfriend because if the price is good it would be good for Roland and my family to own this anyways - but I plan our house there really much). Sadly it turned out that the land and house has been already given. I think the guy gave it to his family friends dauther whom I know and is married to a guy and plan family so at least I will be glad to hear they own it and not someone else ;-)

3. **TODO:** Asking out Amra to go for the holy place in Transylvania (Erdély): I really wish she comes! It is a lot of good energy and in my mind I feel it would be good for us now. Her father is ill and I feel it would be good to go there, but my heart tend to want together going there with her. We can still visit up to Norway in the summer if she comes to the Transylvanian event!

### Edification - things to take home

Originally this point was not here, but I have found that it is good to make a review of the whole period after one makes through it. The biggest surprise to me was coming from the realization of my weakness: I imagined there will be big parts of the weeks where I can get an 'X' in many-many columns all at once and I have ended up with a really bad overall picture.

Other edifications and findings:

0. I am weaker than I ever imagined haha... also I was lazy and not documenting all the things properly in the end. Because of this the end is only an approxmation here :-(

1. Interesting to say, but originally I tried to calculate the length of the activities so that I can do them every day: that is how it became 15 minutes walk or run for example - and walk was actually only there because of rain or snow prohibiting run when not having "home clothes" for it. I should have do it this way I imagined, because I always ended up doing more at a time and less periodically! There was a day when I ran over an hour and well over 5-6 (I don't know) kilometers and when I worked out I used to spend hours too. This would be good maybe but I feel it would be better to just do it every day first.

2. Looking at movies while working out is really a good thing to do. I have watched a lot of Babylon5 and it made the process a lot better.

3. I have found that I should have not included the praying thing - actually I did that anyways when I was able so I had a bad conscience that felt like I am only doing it for this list. That was really bad - however I also didn't know how much it helped to keep up really not forgetting about it as I tried to at least force myself.

4. When there is music on the radio - do not pray prayers in which you sing in your head, but better just say it then or you will feel like a fool and not able to concentrate. I actually find it very interesting that it is so much harder to concentrate when there are two things with a rythm and music in it. I guess it was good to try at least and it helps concentration anyways.

5. From the list above it is clear that I am not sleeping well enough. This should be changed.

6. I have found that the upcoming elections also made it harder for me to not do this properly. Even though I am not a polititian, I have taken part in many online discussions, events and things like that. Some of them are better answered by people like me - but some of them were just wasting my time. Also it can really upset us to see what some people are saying and how bad manipulations are from abroad :-(

7. I have found out that many of the guitars are missing the strings because the music shop in Dorog got closed :-(.

8. There was no day in which I did all the good things at the same time... Today (saturday before easter) there is still chance to fix this, but I am not sure if I am strong-enough for that...

9. Actually I feel I should make an extra week right after this period: it will be good to pray a bit for the elections to go in the way God wants it (not how I want it, just how he wants - and I do not know that, only hope we wish the same). Also it worths the effort to make the extra week when I look at the above table with so few 'X'
